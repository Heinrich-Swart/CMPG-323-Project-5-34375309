# What the project is about

I used Power BI to create a visual presentation of the data. Within the presentation, I include a 'Device Monitoring' tab, that contains graph to represent the 'Number of Device within a Category', The Number of Devices that is active' and the 'Number of each Device in each Zone'. In the 'Device Registration' tab, there is three graphs that constains when the 'Devices was installed', 'Number of Devices in each Category' and a timeline of when 'Each device was installed'.
This will give the stakeholders a view that is easy-to-understand and that they can visually see what the data has captured.

# Struggles

I could not use my 'Project 2', because my credits has expired and the project is not hosted anymore. 
I did not add anything to the 'High-level Metrics' tab, as I was not sure what to include within the tab.
As I cannot use my 'Project 2', I used the Excel that was provided to us, as it contained data that I could use.
